Here begins the deficiency list: [Deficiency Title or Unknown]

Issue description: [Describe the deficiency, its potential causes, and recommended solutions succinctly. Keep descriptions and suggestions on a single line without indentation.]

[Indicate the likelihood or percentage of the deficiency, assigning 50.0 if the issue is unknown. Avoid labeling with 'Percentage'.]

[Do not omit any sections. Maintain consistency in format for each identified deficiency, striving to list a minimum of three.]

[Examples provided below. Do not copy.]

Poinsettia

Potassium Deficiency

This deficiency is common in poinsettias, especially when they lack adequate fertilizer. Symptoms include yellowing and browning of leaves, which may eventually fall off. To rectify this issue, consider fertilizing your plant with a potassium-rich fertilizer.

Calcium Deficiency

Poinsettias suffering from calcium deficiency often display symptoms such as distorted or necrotic leaf margins. To address this issue, incorporate a calcium-rich fertilizer into your routine. Additionally, ensure optimal soil pH for better nutrient uptake.

20%

Magnesium Deficiency

Yellowing between the veins of older leaves may indicate magnesium deficiency in poinsettias. To remedy this, add a magnesium-containing fertilizer to your watering routine to promote healthier foliage.

10%

Iron Deficiency

If younger leaves turn yellow while veins remain green, it could signal an iron deficiency. Introduce an iron supplement or adjust soil pH for better iron availability to restore vibrant green color to leaves.

80%

Overwatering

Overwatering can lead to yellowing and wilting of poinsettia leaves. To mitigate this issue, reduce watering frequency.
